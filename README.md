# Breast-Cancer-Dataset-Classification
Using three classifiers on Breast Cancer dataset.
This code can give you an overview of three classifiers’ functions including:
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree

‘Breast Cancer’ as a well-known dataset has been used. The performance of the model has been evaluated using confusion matrix and roc curve for threshold in Logistic Regression.
Grid Search Cross Validation as a criterion has been used to suggest the best value for k with the best accuracy. Randomized Search Cross Validation used to suggest the best values instead of using the fixed ones.
